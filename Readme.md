The steps to be performed in this program are:

Collect the size of the array from the user.
Collect the elements of the array from the user.
Create a menu of items: "Find the Mean Value", "Find the Median Value", "Find the Mode Value" and "Exit".
Based on the user's choice, call the respective function and display the result.
Implement three separate functions for computing the mean, median, and mode of the array.
The mean function should accept the array as a parameter and return the mean value as a result.
The median function should accept the array as a parameter and return the median value as a result.
The mode function should accept the array as a parameter and return the mode value as a result.
Use type casting wherever required to convert the data types.
End the program.
